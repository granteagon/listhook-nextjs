# ListHook Marketing Website

## Overview

ListHook is a marketing website for an AI-powered postcard marketing platform designed specifically for real estate agents.

- **Language:** TypeScript 5.x
- **Runtime:** React 19.1.0
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
- **Font:** Inter (via next/font with automatic optimization)
- **Deployment:** DigitalOcean App Platform (configured via `.do/app.yaml`)
- **Email Service:** Resend (for contact form)
- **Node Version:** 20.x (specified in `.nvmrc`)
